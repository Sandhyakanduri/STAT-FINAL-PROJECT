    "text": "Spatial Patterns of arrests across the boroughs of New York City\nThis question aims to explore how arrest activity is distributed geographically across NYC’s five boroughs. It seeks to identify areas with higher or lower arrest counts, revealing potential disparities in law enforcement activity. Understanding these spatial variations provides a foundation for informed decision-making, such as resource allocation, community engagement strategies, and addressing systemic inequalities in policing.\n\n\n\nimage1\n\n\nMethodology: The methodology involves using two datasets: arrest data containing borough codes (ARREST_BORO) and a shapefile with geospatial information for NYC borough boundaries. The borough codes in the arrest data were mapped to full borough names (e.g., Bronx, Brooklyn) to align with the shapefile’s boro_name field. After removing missing values, arrest counts were aggregated by borough using the group_by() and summarise() functions in the dplyr package. The aggregated arrest data was then merged with the shapefile based on borough names, combining geospatial and statistical information. This data was visualized using a choropleth map, a thematic map where boroughs are color-coded based on arrest counts, with darker shades indicating higher arrest activity. Borough names were labeled for clarity, providing an intuitive representation of the spatial distribution of arrests and highlighting geographic disparities in law enforcement activity across NewYork City.\nInterpretation: The map reveals spatial disparities in arrest activity across the city, with arrests concentrated more heavily in Brooklyn and less so in Staten Island.This choropleth map visualizes the spatial distribution of arrests across the five boroughs of New York City. The boroughs are color-coded based on the total number of arrests, with darker shades indicating higher arrest counts and lighter shades indicating lower counts. Here are the key insights:\n\nBrooklyn has the darkest shade of blue, indicating it has the highest number of arrests among all boroughs. This could be attributed to its larger population, higher density, or specific law enforcement practices.\nQueens, Bronx, and Manhattan boroughs have moderate arrest counts, represented by medium shades of blue. While they don’t match Brooklyn’s arrest activity, they show a significant number of arrests relative to Staten Island.\nStaten Island has the lightest shade of blue, reflecting the lowest number of arrests. This aligns with its smaller population size and lower urban density compared to the other boroughs."

    "text": "Highest Concentrations of Arrests in NYC and Variation by Offense Type\nThe aim is to identify areas in NYC with the highest concentrations of arrests and analyze how these vary by offense type, such as theft, assault, or drug-related crimes. This helps uncover spatial crime patterns, understand localized trends, and inform law enforcement strategies and resource allocation.\nMethadology The methodology for analyzing and visualizing arrest patterns in New York City involved several steps to ensure accurate insights and effective visual representation. First, the dataset was imported and cleaned by filtering out missing or inconsistent values, particularly in the Latitude and Longitude columns, and ensuring the data types were consistent for geospatial and categorical analysis. The arrests were categorized into legal categories—Felony (F), Misdemeanor (M), and Violation (V)—using the LAW_CAT_CD column. For spatial analysis, an interactive map was created using the leaflet package, which visualized arrests across NYC boroughs. Different colors were used to represent the legal categories, and clustering highlighted high-intensity areas of arrests.\nThe dataset was further grouped by offense types (OFNS_DESC) to identify the top 10 offenses by the number of arrests. A bar chart was generated using plotly to present this data interactively. Borough-specific arrest patterns were analyzed by grouping the data by borough, offense type, and legal category. This was visualized using a horizontal bar chart to show the distribution of top offenses by borough.\nFor predictive modeling, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models were trained to predict the legal category of an arrest using features such as latitude, longitude, offense description, borough, and demographic details like age group, perpetrator sex, and race. The dataset was split into training and testing subsets, and the models were evaluated based on their predictive accuracy. Feature importance from the Random Forest model was visualized to identify the most significant factors influencing arrests.\nFor predictive modeling, Random Forest and Logistic Regression models were trained to predict the legal category of an arrest using features such as latitude, longitude, offense description, borough, and demographic details like age group, perpetrator sex, and race.

Feature importance from the Random Forest model was visualized to identify the most significant factors influencing arrests.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nInterpretation: In this graph, a map of arrest concentrations by offense type, highlights where arrests are most concentrated in New York City. It shows that high concentrations are found in busy areas like Manhattan and Brooklyn. Felonies are often clustered in specific hotspots, while misdemeanors and violations are more evenly spread across the boroughs.\n\n\n\nimage2\n\n\nInterpretation: A bar chart showing the top 10 offenses, reveals that “Assault 3 & Related Offenses” is the most frequent crime, followed by “Petit Larceny” and “Felony Assault.” This indicates that crimes related to assault and theft are the primary drivers of arrests across NYC.\n\n\n\nimage3\n\n\nInterpretation: This graph shows the importance of features in predicting arrest categories using a Random Forest model. Offense Description (OFNS_DESC) is the most critical factor, followed by geographic features like Latitude and Longitude, highlighting the importance of crime type and location. Demographic features like Perpetrator Race, Age Group, and Perpetrator Sex also contribute but are less significant, with the borough of arrest having the least influence. This emphasizes that crime type and location are key drivers in understanding arrest patterns.\n\n\n\nimage4\n\n\nInterpretation: The accuracy comparison between logistic regression and random forest models demonstrates that logistic regression achieves higher accuracy in predicting arrest likelihood.\n\n\n\nimage5\n\n\nInterpretation: This table highlights the top arrest concentrations in New York City, showing that Assault 3 & Related Offenses is the most frequent crime across all boroughs, especially in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Petit Larceny is prevalent in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, reflecting high commercial activity. Felony Assault is concentrated in the Bronx and Brooklyn, indicating higher rates of severe crimes in these areas. Traffic violations and drug-related offenses are also significant in Brooklyn and the Bronx. These patterns reveal borough-specific crime dynamics, with the Bronx and Brooklyn facing more serious offenses, while Manhattan and Queens see more theft-related crimes, offering insights for targeted law enforcement.\n\n\n\nimage6\n\n\nInterpretation: This chart highlights the top 10 arrest offenses in NYC by borough. Assault 3 & Related Offenses dominate across boroughs, with Brooklyn and the Bronx showing the highest counts. Petit Larceny is most frequent in Manhattan, reflecting its commercial activity, while Felony Assault is concentrated in the Bronx and Brooklyn, indicating a higher prevalence of violent crimes. Miscellaneous Penal Law violations are notable in Brooklyn and Manhattan, showing borough-specific enforcement patterns."

    "text": "Demographic Trends in Arrests by Offense Type\nThe research question, “How do arrest demographics (age, race, gender) vary by offense type?”, seeks to explore the relationship between demographic characteristics of individuals (age, race, gender) and the types of offenses for which they are arrested. so we used The logistic regression analysis to specifically quantify the relationships between arrest demographics (age, race, gender) and the likelihood of arrests for a particular offense type, in this case, ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES.\n\n\n\nimage7\n\n\nMethodology: The methodology involves using logistic regression to analyze how demographics influence arrests for the offense type “ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES.” A binary variable (OFFENSE_BINARY) was created to classify arrests for this offense versus all others. The predictors include AGE_GROUP, which examines the influence of age on arrest likelihood, PERP_RACE, which evaluates the impact of racial identity, and PERP_SEX, which analyzes gender differences. The logistic regression model quantifies how these variables affect the odds of arrest, with positive coefficients indicating increased odds and negative coefficients indicating decreased odds. Predicted probabilities (test_data$predictions) were generated to evaluate arrest likelihoods across demographic profiles in the test set, providing actionable insights into how age, race, and gender correlate with arrests.\nInterpretation: The visualization highlights how arrest demographics, specifically age, race, and gender, vary across five major offense types: ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES, DANGEROUS DRUGS, FELONY ASSAULT, MISCELLANEOUS PENAL LAW, and PETIT LARCENY. Each panel shows arrest trends across age groups (&lt;18, 18-24, 25-34, etc.) for different racial groups, separated by gender. Arrest rates peak in the 18-24 and 55+ age groups for offenses like ASSAULT 3 and FELONY ASSAULT, particularly among Black and White Hispanic individuals. Gender disparities are evident, with males showing significantly higher arrest counts across all offenses. Certain racial groups, such as Asian / Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native, have consistently lower arrest rates, while Black individuals dominate arrests in most violent crimes. The trends reveal clear demographic disparities, emphasizing the intersection of age, race, and gender in influencing arrest patterns across different offenses."
